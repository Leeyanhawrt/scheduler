# Interview Scheduler

Hello user! This is Interview Scheduler, a react focused application that allows a user to see if an interview slot is available for the day, book it and display a list of all interviews for a given week. If a user choose to edit their information or cancel their interview slot, they made do so!

 Our app has several libraries under its belt including HTML and CSS3 using preprocessor SASS for webpage layout and styling, React library for single page DOM manipulation, and Jest/Cypress for unit/integreation/end-to-end testing. Our app offers a dynamic and hassle free experience for the user and we really hope you enjoy using it!
